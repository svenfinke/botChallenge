# botChallenge

This project is aiming to provide a service that can host various
botChallenges. These botChallenges are different games or tasks that have various
complexities. The service will provide a simple interface to implement a new
game and a REST API that handles the communication to a virtually unlimited count
of players.

# Warning! WIP!
This is still work in progress and in a very early stage of development. All
of the code is subject to change.

# Using the Docker container
